# Philosopher

## Summary

The dining philosophers problem states that there are 5 philosophers sharing a circular table and they eat and think alternatively. There is a bowl of rice for each of the philosophers and 5 chopsticks. A philosopher needs both their right and left chopstick to eat.
A hungry philosopher may only eat if there are both chopsticks available.Otherwise a philosopher puts down their chopstick and begin thinking again.

## Acquired skills

In this project I learned some new concepts in parallel computing.
I learned the basics of threading a process and discovered memory sharing mechanisms between threads (mutexes) as well as between processes (semaphores).
